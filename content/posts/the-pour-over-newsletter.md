## [The Pour Over Newsletter](https://www.web.thepourover.org/subscribe?ref=vlvdUpROzN)

I've started to remove myself from gathering updates on world news on social media, because of the heavy overload of people's opinions. I've come across this newsletter that is a trustworthy news resource that gives me hope for the future. A lot of other news sources feel like they want to keep in you a state of fear and worry. [The Pour Over](https://www.web.thepourover.org/subscribe?ref=vlvdUpROzN) doesn't do that for me.
