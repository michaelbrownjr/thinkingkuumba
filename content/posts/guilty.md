## [President Trump was found guilty on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/31/trump-guilty-verdict-swing-states/73895359007/)

> Americans reacted Thursday to the historic conviction of former President Donald Trump on 34 felony charges with a mixture of surprise, joy, anger, indifference and expletives.

*Expletives: an oath or swear word.*

>It is the first time in American history a former president or major party candidate has been convicted of a crime, and the momentous decision left many people stunned.

## Eternal Perspective
This verdict is big world news but small eternal news. We shouldn't allow this (or any other trial) to consume our thoughts, direct our emotions, or dull our hope. God is not shaken or surprised, and our job as his followers has not changed: love God and love others.
