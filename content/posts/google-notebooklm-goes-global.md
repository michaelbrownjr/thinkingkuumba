Editorial Director Steven Johnson and Product Manager Raiza Martin from Google Labs on The Keyword: 

> We’ve been amazed by the range of uses that people are finding for NotebookLM. Because the product was developed in close partnership with authors, students and educators, we’ve seen many early adopters integrate it into research and writing workflows. Best-selling author Walter Isaacson has been working with NotebookLM to [analyze Marie Curie's journals for research on his next book](https://x.com/WalterIsaacson/status/1793094718219599908). We’ve seen similar enthusiasm from documentary and podcast researchers who need to sift through complex archives to generate scripts or story ideas.

> Our goal from the beginning with NotebookLM has been to create a tool to help you understand and explore complex material, make new connections from information, and get to your first draft faster. You can upload sources — your research notes, interview transcripts, corporate documents — and instantly NotebookLM becomes an expert in the material that matters most to you. Today’s upgrade introduces several new features:

> - NotebookLM now supports Google Slides and web URLs as sources, along with Google Docs, PDFs and text files.
> - Inline citations now take you directly to supporting passages in your sources, so you can easily fact-check the AI response or dive deeper in the original text.
> - Notebook guide gives you a high-level understanding of your sources by converting them into useful formats like FAQs, Briefing Docs or Study Guides.

I wish I had [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) available during my undergrad studies. Today, I'll most likely use it to understand long complex documents and rules for board games.
