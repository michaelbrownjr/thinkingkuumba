## WWDC Keynote was on June 10th 2024, and it was a big one

**Apple's Vision Pro: Playing Catch-Up, Not Leading the Way?**

Apple's Vision Pro, the company's highly anticipated foray into spatial computing, has barely had time to settle in before Apple announced visionOS 2 at WWDC. While the updates are welcome, they also raise some eyebrows.

New hand gestures? A feature already available on Meta Quest 3. Higher resolution and larger size virtual displays? Again, something Meta Quest 3 has boasted for some time. It seems like Apple is playing a game of catch-up, rather than setting the pace for innovation.

Sure, the Vision Pro is a niche product with a hefty price tag. But for that kind of investment, users expect to be at the cutting edge, not trailing behind. While Apple's loyal fans may be quick to embrace these updates, it's hard not to wonder if the Vision Pro is living up to its promise of revolutionizing the way we interact with technology.

Only time will tell if Apple can truly differentiate the Vision Pro and deliver on its vision for the future. In the meantime, it's worth keeping an eye on competitors like Meta who are already delivering features that Apple is just starting to roll out.

{{< threads C8Cy4dQvF53 >}}

At WWDC 2024, Apple unveiled several new features and updates for iOS, excluding the Apple Intelligence aspects:

**Customization:**

* **Enhanced Home Screen:** Users can now arrange apps and widgets in any open space on the Home Screen.
* **Customizable Lock Screen:** Buttons at the bottom of the Lock Screen can be personalized.
* **Expanded Control Center:** Quicker access to more controls within Control Center.

**Photos App Redesign:**

* **New Single View:** Photo libraries are automatically organized into a new single view.
* **Helpful Collections:** New collections make it easy to access favorite photos.

**Mail App Improvements:**

* **Simplified Inbox:** On-device intelligence sorts emails into categories.

**Messages Updates:**

* **All-New Text Effects:** New text effects are added to iMessage.
* **Messages Over Satellite:** Users can now communicate via satellite in the Messages app when cellular or Wi-Fi are unavailable.

**Other Notable Features:**

* **Enhanced Privacy:** iOS 18 cracks down on apps requesting full address book access, offering a two-step permission process.
* **Improved Spotlight Search:** Spotlight now supports natural language queries, making it easier to find content within apps.

Overall, these iOS updates focus on enhancing customization options, improving the user experience in core apps, and bolstering privacy features. While Apple Intelligence is a significant part of iOS 18, these other additions contribute to making the iPhone more personal, capable, and user-friendly.

## Apple Intelligence

**I loved the name, but now I hate it**

{{< threads C8C3wuZP3a9 >}}

Everything announced about Apple Intelligence looks very promising. What makes the whole thing seem more dissapointing is the fact that most, if not all, of it won't be available this fall let alone before 2025; according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-16/when-is-apple-intelligence-coming-some-ai-features-won-t-arrive-until-2025-lxhjh86w?cmpid=BBD061624_POWERON&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=240616&utm_campaign=poweron). 

Overall, this still felt like the biggest WWDC I've ever witnessed. Apple had to swing for the fences to please shareholders and the stock market. They did a great job doing so, but it doesn't seem like the average consumers are phased. 

What do you think?
