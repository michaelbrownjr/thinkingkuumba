Out of the box, your new Galaxy S24 greets you with a familiar trio â€“ the navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen. While comfortable for some, Samsung offers an alternative: gesture navigation. It expands your screen real estate, offers a sleek, intuitive way to control your phone, and it still gives you access to the new Circle to Search feature. Here's how to switch to it. 

**Step 1: Open Settings**
**Step 2: Tap "Display"**
**Step 3: Tap "Navigation bar"**
**Step 4: Tap "Swipe gestures."**
