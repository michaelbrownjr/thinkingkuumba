### Synopsis
> *“Constellation”*  stars Noomi Rapace as Jo — an astronaut who returns to Earth after a disaster in space — only to discover that key pieces of her life seem to be missing. The action-packed space adventure is an exploration of the dark edges of human psychology, and one woman's desperate quest to expose the truth about the hidden history of space travel and recover all that she has lost.

Apple TV+ has some pretty good content in the Sci-Fi genre. One of the hardest things I've noticed about sci-fi films is that, if the effects budget is short, the quality of the film will take a big hit. Apple seems to be spending a lot of money on sci-fi content, even if the script and story is average, the visual quality and cinematography is usually top-notch. 

The synopsis of the series makes this look like my next series I'll be checking out.
