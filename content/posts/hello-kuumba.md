### Hello world, 

I think I’ve started quite a few blog posts with that intro before. I’d like to keep this short and sweet seeing as who likes to read intros anyhow? I know I sure don’t. Anyway, this space will be my ultimate canvas for my creative thoughts. Though they may not be as transparent as my posts spread across social media on instagram or threads. This space will allow me to share more of my favorite creative thoughts. Something I’d like to hold onto for a long time and own. Because ownership is important. I’ve spent a lot of time blogging on other platforms like Facebook, Google+, Medium, and even Twitter and I’ve been blessed to have experienced moments in my life with people and special products that I’d like to share. One thing I’ve learned is that when you place your creativity on platforms that you don’t own, you can’t predict the future of their existence or even how they are presented to the world. “Thinking Kuumba” changes that for me. It is the space for me to do as much as I can, in the way I can, in order to leave my community more beautiful and beneficial than I left it. At least, I’d like to think it does. Who knows we shall see. 

For now, I’d like to do something a little fun to bring in the new year and year space. I saw people sharing some of the daily apps and services that they use and I’d like to make this an annual tradition. Without further ado, here we go:
