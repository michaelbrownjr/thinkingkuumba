### Hello world, 

So what is, "Thinking Kuumba"? "Thinking Kuumba" refers to a creative and innovative mindset. The word "Kuumba" is from the Swahili language and means "creativity." It's one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa, an African-American and Pan-African holiday that celebrates family, community, and culture. In the context of Kwanzaa, Kuumba emphasizes the importance of leaving communities more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited them, often through creative and innovative efforts. Therefore, "Thinking Kuumba" implies a focus on creativity and continuous improvement in one's approach to problems and life in general.

This space, "Thinking Kuumba" will allow me to share more of my favorite creative thoughts. Something I’d like to hold onto for a long time and own because ownership is important. I’ve spent a lot of time blogging on other platforms like Facebook, Google+, Medium, and even Twitter and I’ve been blessed to have experienced moments in my life with people and special products that I’d like to share. One thing I’ve learned is that when you place your creativity on platforms that you don’t own, you can’t predict the future of their existence or even how they are presented to the world. 

“Thinking Kuumba” changes that for me. It is the space for me to do as much as I can, in the way I can, in order to leave my community more beautiful and beneficial than I left it. At least, I’d like to think it does. Who knows we shall see. For now, I’d like to do something a little fun to bring in the new year and year space. I saw people sharing some of the daily apps and services that they use and I’d like to make this an annual tradition.
