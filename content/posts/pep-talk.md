- Your voice matters. Share your unique perspective.
- Embrace the quiet moments. They're not awkward, they're comfortable.
- Focus on connection, not conversation. One meaningful exchange is enough.
- Remember, everyone feels a little awkward at times. You're not alone. 
- You have a lot to offer. Be yourself and let others see your strengths.
