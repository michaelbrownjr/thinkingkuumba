I change my lockscreen and homescreen often. Most of the time, I do it to better organize my apps and widgets to prepare me better for the week to come. Other times, I do it just because I'm bored and it's fun to recreate my own identity on my homescreen. It's one of the many reasons why I prefer Android over iOS. Alas, since I change my homescreen and lockscreen often, I figured I'd keep a weekly digital archive of it, accompanied with my philosphy as to why I chose my design.Therefore, today starts to the first of many. Welcome to my **"Screen Scene"**.

On my lock screen I have the "Urban Tranquility" photo shot by UX Lead of Pixel Camera and Photos, Bhushan Mondkar. It's one of the Community Lens collection in the Wallpaper app on Pixel.
On my homescreen, I use the ["Blur Wallpaper" app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.appdictive.blurwallpaper) to blur and darken the wallpaper to better view the apps and widgets on my homescreen. 

My screens are relaxing, yet informative as I'm gearing up to take a trip to the west coast full of apartment tours and a hotel reservation. I'll be working out there during the week, so I'll need some of my Google calendar front and center, which is why I have the widget present here. Another useful tool, that I find to be one of the most useful features on the Pixel is the ["At A Glance" widget](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/10070514?hl=en). It provides me with relevant information at the right time, such as my flight gate number, hotel reservation check-in time, the local weather, and many other things. 

I usually don't use folders on my homescreen, but this past week, I realized how much easier it made me not to have to open up the App Drawer to look for an app I typically use. This also applies to the suggested app location on the bottom right of my homescreen. Usually the app that I used last is at that spot, but sometimes I'm surprised with how the Pixel's AI can rightfully predict what app I want next. 

Lastly, and back at the top, I know I'm going to need a quick glanceable view of the battery of my earbuds, watch, and phone while I'm out. I'm bringing plenty of chargers with me, but I think it's good to be mindful of how much juice I have. I don't want to be that person on a plane with absolutely nothing but his thoughts in between his ears. I'm not insane. 

Something I read recently was a [good quote from Jason Stirman](https://betterhumans.pub/beautility-my-ultimate-iphone-setup-1b3dd0c588a0#:~:text=My%20home%20screen%20makes%20me%20calm.%20It%20feels%20like%20a%20blank%20canvas%20which%2C%20for%20a%20creative%20person%2C%20is%20inspirational) on his philosophy of his homescreen setup. And I feel his sentiments.  
> My home screen makes me calm. It feels like a blank canvas which, for a creative person, is inspirational.

Until next time! 👋🏾
