> We're excited to announce the Gemini app is now available in India, supporting English and nine Indian languages: Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. Now, whether you need to plan a game night, create a recipe with specific ingredients, or craft a social media caption, Gemini is available on the go. The app allows you to type, talk, or even add an image to get the assistance you need. Take a picture of a flat tire for instructions on how to change it, or get help writing that perfect thank you note â€“ the possibilities are endless. This marks a significant step forward in our journey to build a truly conversational, multimodal, and helpful AI assistant.

Let's see what this integration means for the future of Android since Google announced Gemini will be part of Android's DNA.
