[‘Schmigadoon’ Canceled After Two Seasons at Apple TV+](https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/schmigadoon-canceled-apple-tv-1235876672/)

Joe Otterson, at Variety.com, broke the news of Schmigadoon's co-creator Cinco Paul sharing about the shows cancellation on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2QCQr7pvpb/). 

> “I am sad to share that Apple will not be moving forward with Season 3 of Schmigadoon!” Paul wrote. “The season is written (including 25 new songs) but we unfortunately won’t be making it. Such is life. I want to thank everyone involved with the show, our incredible cast and crew and writers, our wonderful supporters at Broadway Video, Universal and Apple, for everything they did to make it happen. It’s a miracle we even got two seasons, honestly, and I’m so grateful we did.”

Why does it feel like most shows these days don't last past 2 seasons? Especially during these last couple of years. Though I never watched "Schmigadoon", I saw this in my Google Discover feed and it brought up some frustrations. Recently, my wife and I are hesitant to jump onto a new series because we get really invested in the characters and stories. It's frustrating to get into a plot of a story only to have it not completely finished and the show canceled. Another good example of this was the show, ["Messiah"](https://g.co/kgs/CEu89D8) on Netflix. 

> "Messiah" explores the relationship between religion, politics, and faith. The series is about a CIA officer who investigates a man and his followers who have gained international attention for their public disruption. The officer suspects the man, al-Masih, of being a fraud with ulterior motives. The series stars Michelle Monaghan and Mehdi Dehbi and is available to watch on Netflix

This show was amazing! By only viewing the trailer, we knew we were in for a ride only to realize on the last episode that the show was quickly canceled after only one season. We were shook. **SHOOK!** I tell you. It's moments like those that make [people have commitment issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/rv4w8k/cancellation_apprehension_prevents_me_from/).
