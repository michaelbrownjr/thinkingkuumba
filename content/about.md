What is, "Thinking Kuumba"? "Thinking Kuumba" refers to a creative and innovative mindset. The word "Kuumba" is from the Swahili language and means "creativity." It's one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa, an African-American and Pan-African holiday that celebrates family, community, and culture. In the context of Kwanzaa, Kuumba emphasizes the importance of leaving communities more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited them, often through creative and innovative efforts. Therefore, "Thinking Kuumba" implies a focus on creativity and continuous improvement in one's approach to problems and life in general.
